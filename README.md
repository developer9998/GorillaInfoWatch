### Player Significance
Each player in the game, including yourself, will likely have some form of significance, ranging anywhere from room master, to representing a group, and even as a recognized user.

The mod uses GorillaFriends to expand significance to including friends, verified (in light green), and recently played with users (in light red).

### Notifications
It's always nice to be notified of information when you need it the most, and GorillaInfoWatch has you covered!

Examples of notifications the player could recieve include when certain players (with significance) join or leave the current room, room join failures, server messages, and quest completions.

### Custom Screens
The majority of the features listed prior to this are known as "screens", though built-in to the mod, don't differ much from custom screens.

With knowledge in mod development and the infrastructure of GorillaInfoWatch, developers can create their own custom screens using widgets and utilites to be run by GorillaInfoWatch.

## Usage
